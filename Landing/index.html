			<h3> My first travel : Malaysia </h3>
		<p>
			Located just opposite Kota Kinabalu, a 10-minute boat ride away, Gaya Island is ideal for enjoying the beach and getting a glimpse of the equatorial jungle. The island is actually occupied by several hotels and you have to stay in one of them to enjoy it. We stayed at the Gaya Island Resort, a very nice 5 star hotel, perfect for a quiet and romantic couple stay (about 200 euros for a double room). You can easily spend three days there as there are many activities to do beyond just enjoying the pool or the different beaches. The ideal is to take a boat trip to go snorkeling. The seabed is sublime and you can see tropical fish of all colours. You can also go kayaking through the mangrove.
